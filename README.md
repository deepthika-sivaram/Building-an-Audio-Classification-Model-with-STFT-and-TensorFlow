# Audio Classification Model with STFT and TensorFlow  

This project demonstrates how to build an **audio classification model** using **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** and **TensorFlow**. The model processes audio signals, converts them into spectrograms, and classifies them into different categories using deep learning techniques.  

## ðŸ”¹ Overview  
- **Dataset**: ESC-50 (or any environmental sound dataset)  
- **Feature Extraction**: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to generate spectrograms  
- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Objective**: Classify audio clips into predefined categories  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
âœ” Converts raw audio signals into frequency-time representations (spectrograms)  
âœ” Uses STFT instead of Mel spectrograms for better frequency resolution  
âœ” Built with TensorFlow for deep learning-based classification  
âœ” Achieves high accuracy on environmental sound classification  


## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage
